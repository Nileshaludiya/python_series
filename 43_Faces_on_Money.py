# It is common for images of a countryâ€™s previous leaders, or other individuals of historical significance, to appear on its money. The individuals that appear on banknotes
# in the United States are listed in Table 2.1.
# Write a program that begins by reading the denomination of a banknote from the
# user. Then your program should display the name of the individual that appears on the
# Individual Amount
# George Washington = $1
# Thomas Jefferson = $2
# Abraham Lincoln = $5
# Alexander Hamilton = $10
# Andrew Jackson = $20
# Ulysses S. Grant = $50
# Benjamin Franklin = $100
# banknote of the entered amount. An appropriate error message should be displayed
# if no such note exists.
# While two dollar banknotes are rarely seen in circulation in the United States,
# they are legal tender that can be spent just like any other denomination. The
# United States has also issued banknotes in denominations of $500, $1,000,
# $5,000, and $10,000 for public use. However, high denomination banknotes
# have not been printed since 1945 and were officially discontinued in 1969. As
# a result, we will not consider them in this exercise.
